# Testcase Runner

## Something You Should Know

This tool comes with [**testcase-gen**](https://github.com/JacobLinCool/testcase-gen).

It works with testcases that generated by **testcase-gen**.

But of course, you can use it without **testcase-gen** by generating same-structure testcases manually.
